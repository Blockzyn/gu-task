In the fall of 2014 we were all like, “If we love to play games so much, why not make our own games in the future?” we said. This was our first step towards our gaming dream.<br><br>We took action to turn our idea, which remained a mere thought for two years, into reality. After graduating from high school, we started to learn how the game industry works. Hüseyin Dur and Semih Şahin together set out to find the answer to the question “How to make a game?”. We were just starting to take our first steps on a RTS (Real-time strategy) project, a game genre we love. Bilal Habeş Horoz, who started his career with graphic design a year later, joined our team and changed his career towards character modeling. After a while Burhan Kanat joined our team summer 2018.<br><br>We continued to improve ourselves until we met Game Factory in July 2020. As of this moment, we gained momentum and started to learn about the industry faster. We grew our team by meeting Emir Furkan Tokkan at Game Factory. After a while, we proved ourselves and qualified to join Games United. In partnership with Games United we are developing casual and hypercasual games. In this process, we made very good friendships and valuable teammates, and we started to work with all our strength to steer the game industry in unity and solidarity under the umbrella of Artuex Games.<br>‍</p>

We started our first work by developing hypercasual games within the Game Factory ecosystem. We gained new experiences in every game we made, and our test results started to be more positive. We are currently one of Games United teams and we continue to produce games as well as we can.<br><br>We embarked on this adventure as the four people in our team, two game developers, two 3D artist and a game designer. In the future, we aim to take our work to higher levels by adding another developer and an artist to our team. Although we are a team with an average age of fifteen and less experience than other teams at this level, the fact that we all take this job seriously and try to achieve something is one of the biggest factors in our writing this article. The support of our families has also a very important effect on our motivation! We are proud to share our team and workspaces with you.<br><br>As a team, we focus currently on mobile games. We have ambitious goals and plans in our minds. Every game we develop, every idea we think about, and every topic we discuss brings a new experience to our team. We believe that we will achieve much greater things in the future thanks to the experience and knowledge we have gained over time.<br>‍</p>

            <p class="paragraph-24"><br>Our story started 13 years ago in an internet cafe. We have spending days long time playing computer games (particularly Metin2). Our friendship has been nurturing those days. In summer 2019 with the casual game idea of Ömer, we decided to game production from game playing mode. We thought about the game days long to give it a shape. Afterwards, we wanted to understand how to realize this and joined the Oyunla Gelecek game camp as the start. We had a nice experience and network at this camp.<br><br>After consulting to experts in game industry, we decided to postpone our casual game plan to some future date. Instead, we started to make short and medium-term plans. In the meantime, we met Game Factory and received education in their network. This led to the production of our first hypercasual game and our idle genre first game as we wanted to improve our skills in diverse areas.<br><br>Following these developments, we met Games United, who trusted and invested in us. Following a brief period of collaboration with another publisher, today we are excited to be one of the studios that Rollic supports in Turkey. We are determined to publish hit games at the earliest and them look forward to developing our first casual game.<br>‍<br></p>

While this dream was left unrealized due to different reasons, thanks to covid lockdowns we have revitalized this dream and decided to set up our team and start developing games.<br><br>The boom in the mobile gaming industry during the pandemic has attracted our attention. At first, we set up an amateur team with friends who would complete the missing parts of our team. While analyzing mobile game market, we have started to develop hypercasual game prototypes. After having tested our games during three months with different publishers, we realized that our development and testing phases were satisfactory for an amateur team, however, not enough to get into the game market. Despite hiccups in our team during that period, together with Erdogan we have continued to produce, test, and develop our competences.<br><br>During that period, we met Game Factory, whose ecosystem has supported a lot via suggestions and feedback on our games. After a five months period, we received an offer from Games United and set up our studio company. Finally, a new game was about to start for us.<br><br>Following Games United investment, we had Mehmet Gelir, who has always supported us in our journey and SD artist Hüseyin Demirlenk joining our team.<br><br>Very soon we had our publishing agreement and started developing games on a regular basis. After the long period of game development efforts, we have grown up from a four persons team to a nine persons team. We are so grateful of being such a positive and productive team all together.<br><br>We are determined to have a hit game in hypercasual genre first. Once we succeed in this, our aim is to develop a multi-player casual game. It is our biggest dream to develop a game that millions can play simultaneously. We feel that this will not take such a long time…<br>‍<br></p>

At early stages of Spike Games, we focused to understand dynamics of hypercasual game industry with Game Factory. After six months and twelve games, we joined Games United as a venture studio. We developed so many games with Games United under Sezer’s lead. After a short time, we became a partner with Rollic Games. Now we are team with six brilliant people. In this journey we did not limit ourselves with hypercasual genre only. On top of those, we developed smart contracts and blockchain games and acquired Alwox Games to develop into a center of excellence for blockchain games.

            <p class="paragraph-24"><br>We embarked on an adventurous journey from high school classmates; Yılko Games! After five years of private sector experience, I wanted to give my dreams a chance. I am Kuntay Koca as level designer, a high mechatronics graduate of Sakarya University. We started our collaboration with Burhan Yıldırım already in high school. Our journey to develop a Unity-based game for two persons began with him as the game developer, a senior student at Maltepe University Computer Engineering.<br><br>We entered the mobile game industry by establishing the Yılko Games in September 2020. The first game trial took place in November 2020, and we published it on Google Play. Our goal was to achieve organic growth. However, we realized that the sector does not allow for organic growth. Meanwhile, we started developing our first hypercasual game.<br><br>We met Game Factory while we were looking for ways to accelerate our work and contribute to our development. With the right support from Game Factory, we learned the hypercasual genre and developed our work and produced new game prototypes.<br><br>In April 2021, we took the steps towards a partnership with Games United and set up YILKO Games officially. We continue to produce game prototypes with our strong nine-persons team, that consists of two 3D artists, three game developers, one game designer, one level designer and two trainee game developers. When choosing our teammates, we pay attention to have friends with sincerity, sense of responsibility and team-working skills.<br><br>As Yılko Games, our first goal is to have a hit in the hypercasual genre. As of this moment, we will do the necessary capital and team investments to develop casual games as the next target.<br><br>Finding new ideas in company and game development, reaching multiple publishers, and having our prototypes tested is challenging for us. This is where Games United plays a big role and does not leave us alone. It connects us with publishers and mentors us in developing our game ideas. As every entrepreneur goes through, gaining the trust of our non-entrepreneurial relatives is the point where we get tired the most!<br><br>We always move forward by setting short, medium, and long-term goals. As we complete our goals, we continue to progress by setting new goals. While we focus on the projects at hand in the short-term, we create new game ideas in the medium-term and create new projects together with steps to be followed; so that we can make the transition from hypercasual to casual smoothly and develop our technical skills by enlarging our team.<br>‍<br></p>
